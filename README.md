# Improvements

1. **Build a nicer website** - We made an attractive UI to display Zombie and its details.
2. **Add more js code to demo other functionalities**: We added functionalities like changing zombie name, levelling down the zombie.
3. **Add images to demo zombies in a better way**: We added logo which displays name of our team, zombie image and a GIF Image.
4. **Build a Zombie factory/army and demo multiple Zombies**: We created a functionality that creates multiple zombies having unique name and DNA.

Pre-requisites to run the DApp:
1. Install the node modules by npm install.
